# Tweets Deleter

This application was developed using Twitter's latest `Version 2 API` to delete multiple tweets in a single run. **API call limits** and **Tweets fetching limits** were handled properly. Create your own `API KEYS` and use the application for your own without any suspicious third-party access. In order to delete tweets, you must create your own credentials with `read-write` access.

## Authentication

After downloading the application code from **GitHub** you need to create a `.env` file in the root folder with the following credentials.

**Note :** Provide username without *@* character. **Ex :** username is `@Twitter` then provide it as `Twitter`.

```javascript
API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
API_KEY_SECRET="<YOUR_API_KEY_SECRET>"
ACCESS_TOKEN="<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>"
TWITTER_USER_NAME="<YOUR_TWITTER_USER_NAME>"
```
## Deleting Tweets

After creating the `.env`, try to run following script in the root folder of the application.

```console
npm install
```

All set! Now you're ready to delete tweets. Now run the following script and it will start deleting your tweets in a specific time interval.

```console
npm run start
```

## Schedule Delete

This application includes the `Cron Job` facility. Scheduled for every **1** hour. Just by calling this URL, you can schedule your tweet to delete without any extra effort.

```console
GET {{baseURL}}/schedule-delete
```

**Note :** Twitter will allow you to perform **50** API calls per **15 Minutes**. So the application will delete tweets in a particular time interval to incorporate the limits provided by twitter. Twitter will return the most recent **3200** tweets only that matches given parameters for each cycle.
